# Week 1 8/23/21 - 8/27/21

If I told you this first week was a breeze, I would be lying.  My first day started on Monday, leaving early from my town, to drive 170 miles to Awesome INC, just to be late from traffic, and finding a reasonable place to park.  To say the least, It was not a great start to my path to becoming a Web Developer.  So day two rolls around, I'm up early, I'm ready to grind, and focus on my first steps to this program.  I start by attempting to complete the tasks I'm required to do, but due to some website issues, my progress was delayed.  So I wasn't able to start working mid week pretty much.  Day 3 rolls around, and this is the part where everything goes downhill, and currently still is if I'm being honest.  I'm getting blocked left and right, just from simple tasks to do something, or its just a bot issue. 

Day 5 is now a thing, I hit the ground running and start completing my tasks as normal on Github per usual, and I'm still getting blocked left and right.  Unfortunately some tasks can take me up to 1-2 minutes, or some 20-30 minutes while I get lost attempting to do it myself.  While all of this is going on, I ask myself "What exactly am I learning"  Its so easy to get discouraged when you think all you're doing is just completing the instructions and do what you're told to do.  Day 5 was hard for me, although I got stuck on 1 single tasks for hours, I unfortunately didn't get any help for nearly 5 hours.  When I did receive help, It took only 1 minute to finish the task, and all it was, was a simple " comment on a issue ".  

Day 5 is coming to an end, I still haven't started on my blog that I was suppose to be complete by the end of the day, so i had nothing to present on demo day.  This is my blog, this is what I'm doing right now.  I don't even know If I'm doing this correctly.  Hopefully one day I'll look back at this and laugh at how hard I was struggling, but now its a mystery where I'll end up.  I know I'm not the only one struggling, so I have to keep reminding myself, we're all in this together.  

Lets talk about things I've somewhat learned and done this week at Awesome INC week 1 of the program. 

# Github

Github was the main learning experience this week for week 1.  Github has been very challenging for me so far, wondering "will this ever end?".  
Although Github wasn't my favorite learning experience, it is quite useful the things you can do with Github
So, what are some things you can do with github? 

 - Edit code on Github.com 

 - Pasting images

 - Formatting Code
